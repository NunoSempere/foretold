# Foretold Components

This repo has many of the relevant Foretold Components.

There's an example page in the `example/App.re` file. To run this, do:

```
yarn
yarn run start
yarn run dev (in a separate terminal)
```

### Showcase component viewer

To open the component viewer, run:

```
yarn run showcase
```

Showcase should then be available on `http://localhost:1234/showcase/index.html`, while the
example page is available on `http://localhost:1234/index.html` (given no port conflict).

Components included are specified through `showcase/Entries.re`.
