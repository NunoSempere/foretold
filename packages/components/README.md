# Components

This repo has many of the relevant Foretold Components.

There's an example page in the `example/App.re` file. To run this, do:

```bash
yarn dev
```

in a separate terminal

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Showcase component viewer

To open the component viewer, run:

```bash
yarn showcase
```

Showcase should then be available on `http://localhost:1234/showcase/index.html`, 
while the example page is available on `http://localhost:1234/index.html` 
(given no port conflict).

Components included are specified through `showcase/Entries.re`.
