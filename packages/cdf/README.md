# CDF

This library helps convert samples to cumulative distribution functions and probability density functions, and then perform various functions on them. It uses the [pdfast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfast) library to perform Kernel Density Estimation using triangular kernel.

## Samples

Manipulate sets of samples representing a stochastic variable.

Options:

- min: min value. This does not use pdfast's min, but rather removes all of the samples below it. - max: max value. This does not use pdfast's max, but rather removes all of the samples above it.
- size: number of points to represent the pdf or cdf. Defaults to 50.
- width: determine how many points to the left and right does an element affect, similar to bandwidth in kernel density estimation. Defaults to 2.

```js
let mySamples = new Samples([3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 10, 11]);
let pdf = mySamples.toPdf({ min: 3, max: 8, width: 10, size: 1000 });
let pdfXs = pdf.xs;
let pdfYs = pdf.ys;
let cdf = mySamples.toCdf({ min: 3, max: 8, width: 10, size: 1000 });
mySamples.getPercentile(2); // Get the 2nd percentile.
mySamples.getPercentile(95); // Get the 95th percentile.
mySamples.filter({ min: 3, max: 8 }); // Create a new Samples object, with the filter implemented.
```
